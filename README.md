We can build a project using cargo build.
We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
cargo build --release to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in target/release instead of target/debug.
